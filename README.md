# BmMap

Burkholderia multivorans mapping to reference (poc script)

# Purpose 

Ad-hoc script developed for testing purpose and documentation. The
goal is to go from fastq file to an alignment to reference for a
strain sequenced at the lab. Also, to extract sequences that did not
map to the reference and perform denovo assembly on them.
